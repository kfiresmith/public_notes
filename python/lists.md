## Python Lists

**List Format**
```python
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
```
**Accessing Elements in a List**
```python
print(bicycles[0]) # print first element

print(bicycles[-1] # print last element

bicycles[0] = 'zebra' # assign new 1st element value (clobbers what was there originally at element 0)

del bicycles[0] # kill first element

bicycles.insert(0, 'zebra') # adds new element to beginning of list (positional, could say .insert(2, 'zebra') to add as element 3

bicycles.append('zebra') # adds new element to end of list
```

```python

```
